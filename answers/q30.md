### Concept: Linked List
A Linked List is a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next node, forming a chain.

Each node contains:

* Data (the value you want to store)

* Reference/Pointer (link to the next node)

### How it looks:
* [Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> null
  
### Example:
* 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> null

 ### Types of Linked Lists:


| Singly Linked List|	Each node points to next node only.|  
|:---|---:|
| Doubly Linked List|	Each node points to both previous and next nodes.|  
| Circular Linked List|	Last node connects back to the first node (makes a circle).|  

### Applications in Algorithm Design:

|Application|	Where Used|
|:---|---:|
|Dynamic Memory Management	|OS uses linked lists to manage RAM
|Implement Stacks and Queues	|Many stack/queue implementations use linked lists
|Graphs	|Adjacency list in graph representation uses linked lists
|Polynomial Arithmetic|	Store large polynomial expressions
|Navigation Systems	|Forward and backward navigation (doubly linked list)
|Undo Features	|(in software like MS Word) use linked lists for history tracking
