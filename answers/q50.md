 #Concept  
An equilibrium index in an array is an index i such that the sum of elements to the left of i is equal to the sum of elements to the right of i.  
  
sum(arr[0] to arr[i-1]) == sum(arr[i+1] to arr[n-1])  
  
  
#Example  
Input: arr = [-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0]

Index      0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Element   -7   1   5   2  -4   3   0

At index 3 â†’ Left sum = (-7 + 1 + 5) = -1
              Right sum = (-4 + 3 + 0) = -1 

So, index 3 is an Equilibrium Index.<br>

#Applications of Equilibrium index
Interview Problems:

Common in DSA and system design rounds (logic-heavy).

Balance Point Problems:

Helpful in financial data (e.g., break-even point).

Load Balancing:

In distributed systems to balance loads across partitions.

Game Design:

For ensuring balance in scoring, leveling, etc.

Prefix/Suffix Optimization:

Can be used in place of nested loops for performance boosts.
