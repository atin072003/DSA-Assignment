### 1. Subsets  
A subset is any selection of elements from a set, where order doesn’t matter, and elements are either included or not.  
### Example
S = {1, 2, 3}  
### All subsets are:
{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, 
{1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, 
{1,2,3}
<br>  

Total number of subsets = 2^n (where n is the number of elements)  

So for 3 elements, we get 2^3 = 8 subsets.

### 2. Permutations
A permutation is an arrangement of all (or part of) the elements in which order matters.  
### Example  
S = {1, 2, 3}  
### All permutations of 3 elements taken all at once:  
{1,2,3}, {1,3,2}, 
{2,1,3}, {2,3,1}, 
{3,1,2}, {3,2,1} 
<br>  

Total permutations = n! (factorial of n)
For 3 elements → 3! = 6 permutations
