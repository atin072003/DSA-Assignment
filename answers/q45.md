### What is a Priority Queue?
A priority queue is a special type of queue where each element has a priority assigned to it.  

->Higher priority elements are served before lower priority ones.

->If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order of arrival (depends on implementation).  

->It is different from a normal queue (which is just First-In-First-Out).  

### Syntax  

PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();  

### Applications in Algorithm Design:

Application->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	How Priority Queue is Used  
Dijkstra's Algorithm (shortest path)->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Always pick the minimum distance node  
A Search Algorithm* (pathfinding)->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Expand nodes with lowest cost first  
Huffman Coding (data compression)->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Combine lowest frequency nodes first  
Job Scheduling	->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Execute highest priority task first  
Event-driven simulations->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Process next event based on time priority
