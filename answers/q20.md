Algorithm:
1.Base Case:

* For n = 0, the answer is 1 because there’s one number (0) with unique digits.

* For n = 1, the answer is 10 because there are 10 numbers (0-9), all with unique digits.

2.General Case:

* For n > 1, we will count how many numbers with exactly n digits can be formed where each digit is unique.

* The number of valid numbers with n digits can be found by calculating the number of ways to fill each digit position such that no digits repeat:

  * For the first digit: We have 9 choices (1-9, since 0 cannot be the first digit).

  * For the second digit: We have 9 choices (0-9, but excluding the first digit).

  * For the third digit: We have 8 choices, and so on until we fill all n positions.

3.Formula: The total number of valid numbers with unique digits is the sum of all possibilities for numbers with 1 digit, 2 digits, ..., up to n digits:

***count(n)=10×9×8×…(n factors)(for n digits)***
4.Accumulate the count: For n > 1, accumulate the count for all possible n digits and sum it up.  

### Example:
For n = 2 (2-digit numbers with unique digits):

* The first digit can be any number from 1 to 9 (9 choices).

* The second digit can be any number from 0 to 9, except the first digit (9 choices).

So, the total number of valid 2-digit numbers with unique digits is:


***9×9=81***  

For n = 3:

* The first digit can be any number from 1 to 9 (9 choices).

* The second digit can be any number from 0 to 9, excluding the first digit (9 choices).

* The third digit can be any number from 0 to 9, excluding the first two digits (8 choices).

So, the total number of valid 3-digit numbers with unique digits is:

***9×9×8=648***

### Program:
``` Java
public class UniqueDigitNumbers {

    public static int countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 1; // base case for 0 digits
        if (n == 1) return 10; // base case for 1 digit
        
        int result = 10; // for 1-digit numbers, 10 choices (0-9)
        int product = 9; // for 2-digit numbers, 9 choices for the second digit
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            product *= (11 - i); // calculate choices for each subsequent digit
            result += product;
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 3; // For example, 3-digit numbers
        System.out.println("Count of numbers with unique digits for n = " + n + ": " + countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(n));
    }
}
```
### Time and Space Complexity:


* Time	O(n)
* Space	O(1)
  * Complexity: We need to iterate from 1 to n, making the time complexity linear in terms of n (O(n)).

  * Space Complexity: We only need a constant amount of space (O(1)), as we are only using a few variables.
