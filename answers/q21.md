### Approach:
One of the most efficient ways to solve this problem is to use a bit manipulation technique.

### Algorithm (Brian Kernighan's Algorithm):
1.Iterate over all numbers from 1 to n.

2.For each number, use Brian Kernighanâ€™s algorithm to count the number of 1's in its binary representation.

* Brian Kernighan's Algorithm:

  * The core idea is to repeatedly strip the rightmost 1 bit of a number.

  * For a given number x, x & (x - 1) removes the rightmost set bit of x.

  * Count how many times we can perform this operation until the number becomes zero.

3.Sum up the counts for all numbers from 0 to n.

### Explanation:
* Each time you subtract 1 from a number, you flip all the bits after the rightmost 1. When you AND the number with the result, you remove the rightmost 1.

* This operation reduces the number of bits to check efficiently.
