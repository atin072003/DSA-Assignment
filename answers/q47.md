### What is a Histogram Problem?  
A histogram problem usually refers to questions involving histograms (bar charts), where you're asked to compute something based on the heights of bars.

### Why Is This Important in Algorithm Design?
Because it uses:
->Stack-based Algorithms (for efficient processing)

->Monotonic Stack Techniques (next smaller/greater elements)

->Greedy + Optimization

And gives you practice in:

->Range queries

->Prefix/suffix logic

->Dynamic area computation
