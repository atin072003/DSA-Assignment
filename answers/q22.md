### Approach:
A number is a power of two if and only if it has exactly one bit set to 1 in its binary representation. For example:

* 1 (binary: 0001), 2 (binary: 0010), 4 (binary: 0100), 8 (binary: 1000), etc., are all powers of two.

<h2 src = "color: blue;">Key Observation:</h2>
For a number that is a power of two, the binary representation has only one bit set to 1, and all other bits are 0. The following property holds for powers of two:

For any power of two x:


x&(xâˆ’1)=0
This is because:

x has exactly one 1 bit.

x - 1 flips all the bits to the right of the 1 bit in x and changes the 1 bit to 0.

The AND operation between x and x - 1 results in 0.

### Algorithm:
Base Case:

If the number n is less than or equal to 0, it's not a power of two.

For n > 0:

Perform the operation n & (n - 1).

If the result is 0, then n is a power of two.

Otherwise, it's not a power of two.

### Time and Space Complexity:  
* Time Complexity: O(1) because bitwise operations take constant time.

* Space Complexity: O(1) since we only use a constant amount of space.
  
### Program:
``` Java
public class PowerOfTwo {

    // Function to check if a number is a power of two
    public static boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        // Base case: n should be greater than 0
        if (n <= 0) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Check if n AND (n - 1) is 0
        return (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test the function with a few examples
        int[] testNumbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 16, 18, 32};

        for (int num : testNumbers) {
            if (isPowerOfTwo(num)) {
                System.out.println(num + " is a power of two.");
            } else {
                System.out.println(num + " is not a power of two.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```
