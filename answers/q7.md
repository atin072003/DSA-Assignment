### Sliding Window Technique:
Sliding Window is a method to solve problems where you need to process a subset of elements (like a subarray or substring) efficiently without re-processing the whole subset every time.

Instead of recalculating everything again and again:

* You slide a window (fixed or variable size) over the data

* And adjust the result based on what is coming in and what is going out.

### How Sliding Window Works:
* Start with a window (can be size K or based on a condition).

* Move the window step-by-step (like from left to right).

* Update your result smartly (only using the changes).

* Repeat until the end of the array or string.

### Sliding Window Example (String Problems):
1. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
(Leetcode 3 â€” famous question!)

Problem:

Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Idea:

* Use a variable window.

* Expand right side until you see a duplicate.

* Then shrink from left to remove duplicate.

Window grows and shrinks dynamically.
