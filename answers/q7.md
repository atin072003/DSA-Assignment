### Sliding Window Technique:
Sliding Window is a method to solve problems where you need to process a subset of elements (like a subarray or substring) efficiently without re-processing the whole subset every time.

Instead of recalculating everything again and again:

* You slide a window (fixed or variable size) over the data

* And adjust the result based on what is coming in and what is going out.

### How Sliding Window Works:
* Start with a window (can be size K or based on a condition).

* Move the window step-by-step (like from left to right).

* Update your result smartly (only using the changes).

* Repeat until the end of the array or string.

### Sliding Window Example (String Problems):
1. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters


Problem:

Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Idea:

* Use a variable window.
* Expand right side until you see a duplicate.

* Then shrink from left to remove duplicate.

Window grows and shrinks dynamically.

### Example
``` Java
   import java.util.HashSet;

public class LongestUniqueSubstring {
    public static int longestUniqueSubstr(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int left = 0, right = 0, maxLength = 0;
        HashSet<Character> set = new HashSet<>();

        while (right < n) {
            if (!set.contains(s.charAt(right))) {
                set.add(s.charAt(right));
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
                right++;
            } else {
                set.remove(s.charAt(left));
                left++;
            }
        }
        return maxLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "abcabcbb";
        System.out.println("Length of longest unique substring: " + longestUniqueSubstr(s));
    }
}
