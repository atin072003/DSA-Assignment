### Concept: Bit Manipulation
Bit Manipulation means directly working with bits (0s and 1s) of numbers to perform operations.

Instead of using normal math operations (+, -, etc.), we use bitwise operators to access, modify, or check individual bits.

### Common Bitwise Operators:
|Operator | Symbol | Meaning| 
|:--------|:---:|---------:|
AND | & | 1 if both bits are 1
OR | ` | `
XOR | ^ | 1 if bits are different
NOT | ~ | Flips all bits
Left Shift | << | Shift bits to the left (multiply by 2)
Right Shift | >> | Shift bits to the right (divide by 2)  

### Advantages in Algorithm Design:

|Advantage|	Explanation|
|:---|---:|
Fast Computations|	Bit operations are done in constant time O(1).
Space Saving|	Can use bits instead of entire integers/booleans, saving space.
Useful in Special Problems	|Problems like parity checks, power of two, counting set bits, swapping numbers, finding unique elements.
Elegant Solutions	|Some problems like subset generation, masking, combinations are very clean with bits.
